## Overview

Katachi Gen transforms blockchain data into physical art. By interpreting your wallet's ShapeL2 participation data, we generate unique, foldable origami patterns that represent your on-chain journey. Each NFT is both a digital collectible and a printable origami pattern that can be brought to life.

**Katachi (ÂΩ¢)** = Shape/Form in Japanese  
**Gen (Áèæ)** = To Appear/Manifest  
**Together: Shape Revealed**

## How It Works

### üé® Shape to Shape
At mint time, Katachi Gen:
1. **Analyzes** your wallet's ShapeL2 participation data
2. **Generates** a unique 2D origami pattern (FOLD file) 
3. **Determines** fold complexity based on:
   - Stack rank
   - Shape NFTs owned
   - Other MCP data points
4. **Creates** a 3D visualization of the folded form

### üñºÔ∏è Personalized Art
Your NFT features:
- **Custom graphics** representing NFTs owned by your wallet
- **Stack achievements** visually incorporated into the design
- **Printable files** included in token metadata for physical folding
- **Unique patterns** that evolve from simple to complex based on your participation

## Minting Eligibility

- **Requirement**: Must own a Stack NFT on ShapeL2
- **Limit**: 1 Katachi Gen NFT per eligible wallet
- **Uniqueness**: Each mint generates a unique pattern based on current wallet state

## Cultural Inspiration

Inspired by **Origami Kabuto** (traditional Japanese samurai helmet), a playful origami form commonly folded by Japanese youth. Katachi Gen brings this cultural art form into the blockchain era, creating a bridge between ancient craft and modern technology.

## The Vision

Every wallet tells a story through its on-chain activity. Katachi Gen transforms that story into a tangible piece of art - a unique origami form that can exist both digitally and physically, representing your journey in the Shape ecosystem.
